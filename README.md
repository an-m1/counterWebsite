Project Version 1.0

## To Do

- Fix NavBar Menu Button, as the Tabs are not properly being listed in smaller window sizes.
- Complete Counter Settings button, and add its functionality -> Change increments/decrements to values other than the defualt value, 1 (i.e. increase by 2 on every counter click).
- Revamp home page, change the colouring of buttons and images in the slideshow.
- Handle white spaces on "over-scrolling" (basically when you scroll too much in any direction and the end of the page is reached, but stretches the page leaving a white space).
